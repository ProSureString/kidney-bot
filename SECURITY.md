## Reporting a Vulnerability

DM me on discord (server can be found [here](https://discord.com/invite/TsuZCbz5KD))

Please do not report vulnerabilities in the issues section, as this is public and can be seen by anyone.

## Fixing a Vulnerability Yourself

If you want to fix a vulnerability yourself, please fork the repository and create a pull request with the fix. I will review it and merge it if it is good.
